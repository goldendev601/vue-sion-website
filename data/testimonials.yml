I can pull up a report that tells me how much commission is due to me for the current year or next year. I can see how much I made in gross sales and the best is that I can track any past due commission payments with a few simple clicks! It makes reconciling my monthly commission checks super easy! It is very efficient and easy to use. Thank you for creating Sion, you have made my life easier!"
